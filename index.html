        <p>
            Aspiring software developer who is deeply passionate about technology. 
    As a child, I was always curious, often taking apart family laptops to see how they worked and then putting them back together before anyone had noticed. 
    I was introduced to software development at the age of 15 and instantly took a liking to it. 
    I love a challenge and enjoy solving problems. 
    I thrive in roles of leadership and strive to bring out the best in both myself and those I work with. 
    The rush of tests passing and code successfully executing makes software development feel more like leisure as opposed to work for me.
